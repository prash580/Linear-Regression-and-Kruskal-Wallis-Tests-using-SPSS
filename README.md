# Linear-Regression-and-Kruskal-Wallis-Tests-using-SPSS
Analysis is done on Electricity consumption and Dublin city demographics via Statistical methods using IBM SPSS Software

First part of analysis uses Multiple linear regression technique to predict the bill price with KWh as the predictor variable.
Second part of analysis uses Kruskal Wallis test which is a non parametric test as the population does not follow normal distribution to determine whether there is a significant difference in the medians of the divorced,widowed and separated males of Dublin city.

For both the tests alpha value was chosen as 0.05 and preliminary checks were performed to check the suitability of tests.
